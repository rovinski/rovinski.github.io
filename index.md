I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.
After completing my bachelor's in electrical engineering at UM, I elected to stay and continue
working with Michigan's great CSE faculty. My career at Michigan has allowed me to experience a
broad range of technical fields in both electrical and computer engineering - from emerging
applications down to digital circuits. My primary research focus lies in both computer architecture
and VLSI.

## Research

I research computer architecture and VLSI with the amazing Professor [Ron Dreslinski](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rdreslin)
as my advisor in [Cadre group](https://cadre.eecs.umich.edu) (Circuits and Architecture Design
REsearch group). I also formerly worked with Profs. [Jason Mars](http://jasonmars.org) and
[Lingjia Tang](http://www.lingjia.org) in [Clarity Lab](http://clarity-lab.org).

My broad research vision is that Moore's law is ending, so architectures and systems will have to
evolve in order to pick up the slack. More often than not, this means specializing hardware for
emerging applications and integrating solutions from across the hardware/software stack. Check out
my [publications](/pub/) for a list of my recent work.

## Teaching

I have been both an undergraduate Instructional Assistant (IA) and Graduate Student Instructor (GSI)
for ENGR 100 - section 250: Microprocessors and Toys. This class is a personal favorite of mine
because of both the great introduction to computer engineering and the openness of the course
project.

This course is designed to give a broad overview of computer engineering to ambitious
freshman. It covers the basics of computer hardware, including CMOS transistors, digital gates,
small/medium-scale devices, and control and data paths. The course also covers the basics of
low-level programming via assembly, such as ISAs, I/O interfaces, and drivers. The second half of
the course is an open-ended project for groups to work in teams to create a microcontroller-based
toy. It's always very interesting to see the ideas students come up with!

My role as an IA / GSI has been to instruct and supervise labs as well as mentor students on their
projects. Because the projects are so open-ended, students often select projects that require a much
greater working knowledge than the class formally provides through lectures. It's my job to help
teach and guide the students in the material that is often multiple courses ahead of their current
knowledge base, although students often do a good job of learning topics on their own.
