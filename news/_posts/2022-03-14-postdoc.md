  I'm starting a postdoc at Cornell University with Professor Christopher Batten
---

Today marks the first day of my postdoc with Professor [Christopher Batten](https://www.csl.cornell.edu/~cbatten) at Cornell. This was a quick turnaround from finishing my dissertation, but I know that Chris will be a good mentor as I prepare to apply for tenure-track faculty positions.

Chris has been gracious enough to allow me to work remotely from Michigan until the summer. While I don't get any downtime from work, I can afford to decouple moving from starting a new job. I'm very excited to join the team and meet the students!
