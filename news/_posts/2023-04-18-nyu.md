  I'm starting as an assistant professor at New York University this fall!
---

I am thrilled to announce that I have accepted an offer for tenure-track faculty at NYU! I am extremely thankful to everyone who mentored and helped me along the way, from the beginning of my PhD at Michigan through my Postdoc at Cornell.

My work will be focused on the intersection of computer architecture, circuits, and EDA. Specifically, I am interested in exploring future chiplet-based SoCs, optoelectronically interconnected systems, and design automation to build these systems.

Starting this fall, I will be in search of talented PhD students who are interested in addressing these challenges as well as the complexity of chip design. If you or someone you know is applying for PhD programs, please encourage them to apply to NYU!
