My nerves are still calming because I know there are several revisions to be made to my dissertation before deposit, but it looks like this chapter of my life has come to a close!

I'd like to thank my family, friends, and colleagues who attended my defense, especially those who came in person.

I'd also like to thank everyone who supported me during my academic journey thus far. There will be a much more verbose acknowledgement in my dissertation. But for now, I think I'm going to get some rest...
