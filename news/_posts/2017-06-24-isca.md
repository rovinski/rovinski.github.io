  The Cadre Group will be repping U-M at ISCA!

Thanks to the fabulous support of our advisor Prof. Ron Dreslinski, a majority of our research group will be headed to ISCA in Toronto!

Due to the proximity of the conference, our group is renting University vans and making the drive to the conference. I (fortunately/unfortunately) don't have any papers to present, so I'll be around to watch presentations and chat!
