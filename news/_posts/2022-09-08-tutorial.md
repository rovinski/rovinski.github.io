I will be hosting a tutorial on [OpenROAD](https://theopenroadproject.org) at the 2022 International Symposium on Microarchitecture ([MICRO 55](https://www.microarch.org/micro55/index.php)). The tutorial website is available [here](https://the-openroad-project.github.io/micro2022tutorial) and the GitHub repository is available [here](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/micro2022tutorial).

This tutorial is geared towards computer architects and how they can use it to perform free, open-source modeling in their research. It will also cover how to tape out real chip designs for those who have never used implementation tools before.

The tutorial will be a half-day session from 1 PM - 5 PM CST on Saturday, October 1, 2022. Come join!
