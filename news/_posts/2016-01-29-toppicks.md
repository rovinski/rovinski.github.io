  Sirius has been selected for MICRO Top Picks 2016!
---

Our 2015 ASPLOS paper entitled, *Sirius: An Open End-to-End Voice and Vision Personal Assistant and Its Implications for Future Warehouse Scale Computers*, was accepted to the *IEEE Micro: Top Picks* issue for 2016.

## What is *Top Picks*?
The *Top Picks* issue of *IEEE Micro* is a special honor. Authors who have work accepted to one of the top computer architecture conferences (e.g. ISCA, MICRO, ASPLOS) may submit a short-form article explaining the importance and impact of their work for a more general audience. A committee selects the 10-12 most influential papers among them for a special issue.

## Find Out More
The article will be entitled *Sirius Implications for Future Warehouse-Scale Computers* and will be available in *IEEE Micro* Volume 36, Issue 3 (Top Picks). The camera-ready paper will be posted in [Publications](/pub#y-2016) when available.
