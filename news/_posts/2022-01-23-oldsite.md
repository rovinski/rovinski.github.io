  Long live the site!

As I stand on the precipice of graduation, I have been reminded that I need to keep my information up to date (and easy to find). Google has decided that my old website remains more relevant than my new website, so my hand has been forced.

I archived all of the HTML for the old site and replaced each page with a redirect to this site. I believe most search engine crawlers should recognize this and remove stale references.

This website still has a ways to go to fill in the missing spots, but I'm going to try to keep things more up-to-date as I transition beyond Michigan.
